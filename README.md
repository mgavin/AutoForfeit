#AutoForfeit

Have you ever wished you could bypass the mental trauma of having to open the menu, scrolling down to [vote to forfeit], and hitting confirm, when you immediately felt the desire to?

Well then your prayers have been addressed!

With this plugin you can set it to...  
### Start a forfeit when:
- The in-game clock reaches a certain point
- Your team scores a certain amount of goals
- The opponent team scores a certain amount of goals
- The goal differential between your team and the opponent team is a certain amount
- You're in a specific playlist! (have it work in casual 1s and nowhere else, for example)

And for all those options for when you can start a forfeit... They can also be set to occur in response to !!! **a teammate forfeiting!** !!! Wow!  
And you can **disable it while in a party**! (local party or not)

That's pretty much it...
